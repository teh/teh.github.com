    <h1>3d-printing a lens cap</h1><p class="article-date">2016-08-11</p></section>
<article class="markdown-body"><p>While phone cameras are getting really amazing I still like my old Sony because it allows me to fiddle with exposure etc.; It has a very good sensor and lens.</p>
<p>I recently dented the lens casing on a rock. The dent prevents the lens cover from closing and leaves the lens unprotected in my bag.</p>
<p>I found a few candidates for lens caps on the Internet but the reviews had conflicting information on whether they'd actually fit. So I decided to print my own.</p>
<p>I followed <a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/en/tutorial/prepare-your-model-3d-printing-blender/"target="_blank">this tutorial</a> for Blender. After about 1h of modelling I arrived at the following model:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/images/3d-printing-a-lens-cap/3d.png"><img class="img" src="/images/3d-printing-a-lens-cap/3d.png"
        alt="Blender model"/></a></p>
<p>When you click on the model image to zoom in you'll see that the diameter is 6.175 cm. This is 0.175 cm of rim, and exactly 6 cm for the cap diameter. In retrospect I should have reduced the diameter by about ~0.05 cm. While the cap fits on perfectly there is no resistance when removing it, and it can easily fall off by itself. I fixed that by adding extra material with a coating of super-glue on the inside.</p>
<p>After a nerve-wracking 2 week wait (will it fit??) and a total of $18 including shipping my lens cap arrived. It's more red in real life than it looks on my terrible phone camera:</p>

        alt="Cap on the camera"/></a></p>
<p>I'm quite happy with it!</p></article><section class="article-labels"><a class="article-tag li" href=/tags/misc/><span class="hashtag">#</span>Misc</a></section><section class="article-navigation"><p><a class="link" href="/posts/monitoring-nvidia-gpu-with-prometheus/"><span class="li"></span>Monitoring your NVidia GPU with Prometheus</a></p><p><a class="link" href="/posts/deep-learning-python-environment-with-nix/"><span class="li"></span>Deep-learning Python environment with Nix</a class="link">
